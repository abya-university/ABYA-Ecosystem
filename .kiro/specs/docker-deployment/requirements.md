# Requirements Document - ABYA Ecosystem Docker Deployment

## Executive Summary

The ABYA Ecosystem is a Web3-based Learning Management System built with React (frontend) and Hardhat/Solidity (smart contracts) that requires containerization for production deployment. This document outlines requirements for implementing Docker, Docker Compose, and Nginx to create a scalable, secure, and maintainable deployment infrastructure that supports both development and production environments.

## Current State Analysis

### Application Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18.3 application with Vite build system
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity contracts deployed on SKALE network
- **Dependencies**: 46+ npm packages including Web3 libraries
- **Build Output**: Static frontend assets + contract ABIs
- **API Integration**: Web3 RPC endpoints, IPFS (Pinata)
- **Development Server**: Vite dev server on port 5173

### Current Deployment Challenges
1. **Environment Management**: Manual configuration of environment variables
2. **Build Consistency**: Local builds vary between developers
3. **Scalability**: No load balancing or horizontal scaling
4. **Security**: Exposed development servers and keys
5. **Monitoring**: Limited visibility into application health
